How does statistics fit into data science?
:::

## Where do data come from?

Start with a **research question**

1.  What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?
2.  Does a new vaccine reduce incidence rates for a particular disease?
3.  Are average hours of sleep per night related to GPA for graduate students?

## Types of research questions

Broadly speaking, we can categorize research questions into two categories:

-   **Prediction** questions require training a model that will perform well on new data

-   **Inference** questions require a model that can assess relationships between an outcome and predictor variable(s)

. . .

In this class, we will focus on **inference**. Next semester, you will focus more on **prediction**.

## Where do data come from?

Based on the research question, we can identify the **population of interest**.

Often, it is unrealistic to collect data on the entire population, so we collect a **sample**.

But how?

## Sampling

Say I want a sample of five students in this class and I want to measure the proportion of the class that identify as extroverts. How could I choose five people?

## Simple random sampling

-   Gold standard, but not always practical

-   Many statistical methods assume simple random sampling
