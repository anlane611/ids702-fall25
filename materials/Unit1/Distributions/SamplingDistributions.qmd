## Sampling Distribution Illustration

## Central Limit Theorem

 

Let $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ have population mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

$$
\bar{X} \sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$

 

As the sample size gets large, the sample mean becomes normally distributed, with mean $\mu$ and standard error $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ , regardless of the distribution of $X_1,...,X_n$
