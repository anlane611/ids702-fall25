## Random Variables

**Random variables** are variables that can take different values, and the value they take depends on a probabilistic process.

Examples:

| Y=Resting heart rate | Y=congestive heart failure status (1=Yes, 0=No) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 80                   | 0                                               |
| 82                   | 1                                               |
| 78                   | 0                                               |
| 90                   | 1                                               |
| 65                   | 0                                               |

## Probability Distributions

A **probability distribution** is a function that maps a possible outcome of a random variable to its probability of occurrence.

## Key Components of Probability Distributions

-   Support: values that the distribution can take

-   Parameters: values that characterize the distribution

-   PDF/PMF: $f(x)$ , function whose output is a probability of a particular value or range of values

-   CDF: $F(x)$ , function whose output is a cumulative probability up to a particular value

-   Expected value/mean: $\mathbf{E}(X)$

-   Variance: $\mathbf{E}[(X-\mu)^2]$

## Example

|          |     |     |     |     |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| $X$      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| $P(X=x)$ | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.1 |

-   Is this a valid probability distribution?

-   Is this a discrete or continuous distribution?

-   What is the support?

-   What is $P(X=3)$?

-   What is $F(3)$?

-   What is $\mathbf{E}(X)$?

-   What is $Var(X)$?

    Â 

-   What is $Var(X)$?

    -   $Var(X)=\mathbf{E}[(X-\mu)^2]=\mathbf{E}[X^2]-\mathbf{E}[X]^2$ (do this on your own)
