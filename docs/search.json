    "text": "Instructions\nYou are required to complete two statistics reflections during the semester. You can select any material from the list of materials below.\n\nBegin your assignment with a header that includes your name and the title and source of your selected material\nReflect on the material selected. What did it make you think about? How does it affect your work as a data scientist? Note that you are required to engage with the material and provide your thoughts/reactions; you should NOT be summarizing the piece.\nWhile there is no minimum word count for the reflections, you are expected to meaningfully engage with the material (2-3 paragraphs). You can use the suggested questions to get started, but you are not required to answer them in your response.\nYou can use Word or any other text editor to complete this assignment, as long as you submit a PDF to Gradescope. You do not need to use R/Quarto for this assignment.\nIn Gradescope, select the appropriate reflection assignment based on the due date. All of the assignments are already available, so you can complete them at any time!\n\nI am always available if you have any questions or comments about the content presented in these materials. Additionally, if you come across a piece that is not on this list and you would like to use it for a statistics reflection, you are welcome to send me an email. Please include a link to the piece and a brief description of how it connects data science and society.\nNote: It is not appropriate to use ChatGPT for this assignment. The task is to offer your personal reflections/thoughts; there are no right or wrong answers here."

How do you think this can be done? Is it possible to use biased data without reaching biased predictions?\n          Can you think of other examples in which using data to predict future behavior could do more harm than good?\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        Data sonification (podcast)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Loud Numbers: Listen to whichever one of the podcast episodes looks most interesting to you.
